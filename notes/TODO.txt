Update spec to account for e.g. __radd_ and NotImplemeneted
Update code to match updated spec

Make sure spec is properly idempotent (i.e. we're not accidentally evaluating
expressions more than one when we shouldn't be). I have a hunch it's not.

Related to the above, it might be time to get rid of the normalization phase
and make simplification write lamia code directly (which is normalized, of
course)
